# Synthetic benchmarks

This folder contains single-loop based programs, not performing a useful computation but emulating a predefined statistical distribution of the execution times. In particular:
- `dist_exp`: the number of loops follow an exponential distribution;
- `dist_gamma`: the number of loops follow a gamma distribution;
- `dist_normal`: the number of loops follow a normal distribution;
- `dist_uniform`: the number of loops follow an uniform distribution;
