# Basic benchmarks

This folder contains very simple programs, such as simple loops or finding the maximum of an array. In particular:
- `array_stats`: it computes simple statistics (sum, mean, variance, std and coorelation) for two random arrays;
- `binary_search`: it searches for an element in a random array exploiting binary search algorithm;
- `bsqrt`: it comuptes square root of a random number exploiting Babylonian method;
- `eq_root`: it computes complex roots of a random quadratic equation;
- `exp_int`: it computes Ei(x) for a random number;
- `fibonacci`: it computes recursively a random term of the Fibonacci's sequence;
- `matrix_nn`: it counts the non-negative elements inside a random matrix;
- `mc_integral`: it computes the value of an integral using Monte Carlo method;
- `multi_search`: it searches for an element inside a matrix;
- `select_nmax`: it selects the n-th grater element inside a random array;
- `unstruct`: simple example of unstructured code;
