This folder contains complex programs. In particular:
- `ann`: it trains a random ANN with multiple hidden layer on random data;
- `canny`: implemention of Canny edge detector, it performs edge detection on a random/user defined grayscale image;
- `img_scaling`: it performs image scaling, through bicubic interpolation, on a random/user defined grayscale image;
- `jpeg_compress`: it performs JPEG compression on a random/user defined RGB image;
- `latnav`: it consists of a sequence of PID controllers emulating an aircraft autopilot for lateral navigation; 
- `acas`: it emulates the 'Airborne Collision Avoidance System' (ACAS) with a variable number of aircrafts.
